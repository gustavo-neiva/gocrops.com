GoCrops

GoCrops is a web application that helps farmers track prices for their crops. The idea was to develop a platform to scrap price information, create a simple price trends tool and gather data from the farmers in form of: crops produced, farm location, harvest dates, harvest quantity and distribute this information for wholesalers and marketplaces through an API.

For the MVP, all our price data was gathered from "https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/sites/agriculture/files/markets-and-prices/price-monitoring/market-prices-all-products_en.csv".

GoCrops was developed in two weeks in Le Wagon coding bootcamp batch #84 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by:
